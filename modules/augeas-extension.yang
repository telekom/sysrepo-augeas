    description
      "The string contains the path to the data node in the augeas tree.
       Each data node in the augeas tree has a 'label' indicating the node name.
       The 'label' can be specified directly using the lense primitive 'label STR',
       or it can be variable using the regular expression 'key RE',
       or variable using the number 'seq STR'.
       The data node address therefore consists of the 'labels' sequence of the parent nodes.

       The variable ones 'key STR', 'store STR' and 'seq STR' must be somehow marked in the data-path.
       In the data-path, these variables are denoted by the symbol '$$' followed by the name
       of the yang node (refers to 'key STR') or it is followed by a keyword.
       The keyword '$AY_UINT' indicates a numeric value and refers to 'seq STR'.

       Another special symbol is '^^' followed by the name of the list key.
       This symbol indicates that the node was implicitly generated for the list key
       and stores the augeas value of the node specified by 'store' lens primitive.

       The special symbol '##' may occur at the yang list node and indicates
       that the key was implicitly generated only for the indexing list's records.

       NOTE: Look at the corresponding tests of a particular augeas module
       (located somewhere in augeas/lenses/tests/test_*) for a better understanding
       of what the path consists of.";
